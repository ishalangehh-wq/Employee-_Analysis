# Employee Data Analysis using Pandas 🧮

This project is a simple Python-based data analysis task performed using **Pandas**.  
It demonstrates how to read CSV files, analyze employee data, and perform different operations like grouping, sorting, and applying conditions.

## 📘 Project Overview

The dataset (`employee.csv`) contains details such as:
- Employee ID  
- Name  
- Department  
- Salary  
- Experience  
- Status (Active/Resigned)

Using this data, the project performs:
- Data inspection (`shape`, `columns`, `info`)
- Filtering employees by experience
- Sorting by salary (descending order)
- Grouping data to find:
  - Average salary per department  
  - Total experience per department  
- Creating pivot tables to compare department-wise employee status
- Adding new columns:
  - **Bonus (10% of Salary)**  
  - **Emp_status** based on salary  
  - **Performance** category (High / Medium / Low)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas Library 📊  
- CSV File Handling  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have **Python** and **Pandas** installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
3. Run the file
   **python main.py**
4. You wiil see the output of analysis in the console.

## 📊 Example Output

Department
HR           41500.0
IT           66250.0
Marketing    55000.0
Sales        42000.0
Name: Salary, dtype: float64

## 🏁 Conclusion
